Four types of users: Owner, Team Member, Office/Admin, Agent/Employee

when agent/employee completes form, update a property within their user object
send three emails, one at creation with link to form (which has their token), one at 24 hours and one at 72 hours after created reminding them to complete the form
Token expiration???
 - if yes, office/admin can reset

 Admin Dashboard looks like what?
  - search for user first/last name or by date range
 - line graph showing total number of sent/completed by month
  - form to send link to form to user
 - link to form editor
 - Average times from invitation to completion, then completion to setup
 - Stats for setups by Team Member
